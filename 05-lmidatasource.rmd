# LMI Data Source

In this section, we are introducing LMI data sources, the corresponding dataset and their strengths and limitations for state vocational rehabilitation agencies. This is not an exhaustive list and each state may have additional sources. We have compiled them by public data sources and private data sources. 
We have divided the data sources by their ownership i.e., public data sources and private data sources. Most of the data sources listed in this section are available for free. However, some data sources are subscription based or require a fee.
Most of the description text, when available is taken from the websites that describe the datasources. We intend to continual update this list with the most recent links, new data sources and any other changes.
